# Poly
"Old" class project that I completed in 2025 to build my skills, creates a class called Poly, which works with polynomials in C++. The idea behind it is to work with dynamically allocated arrays to practice managing memory working with pointers and developing OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
